# Mininet-wifi-Stimulation
This project is aim to understand how our devices are connected to the wireless internet using a virtual environment that we set up. In our environment, three access points are connected via ethernet and one mobile station will be moving across access points. Two experiments were carried out: First, to monitor what happens to ping requests when a mobile station moves across different access points. Second, monitor how the signal strength changes as a mobile station move to different parameters of the access points. 

Mini-net does not have a wifi function installed, so we have to downloaded an open source emulator to run wifi on mini-net interface.
